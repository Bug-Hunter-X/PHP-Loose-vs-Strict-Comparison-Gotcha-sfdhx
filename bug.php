In PHP, a common yet often overlooked error is the misuse of the `===` (identical) operator versus the `==` (equal) operator.  This subtle difference can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with type juggling.  For example:

```php
$a = 1;
$b = "1";

if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Equal\n"; // This will execute
}

if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Identical\n"; // This will NOT execute
}
```

The `==` operator performs loose comparison, converting types as needed before comparing values. The `===` operator performs strict comparison; it only returns true if both the value and the type are identical.  This difference is easily missed and can cause logic errors that are hard to debug.
