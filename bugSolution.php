The solution lies in consistently using the strict comparison operator (`===`) unless you specifically need loose comparison.  This prevents unexpected type coercion and makes the code's logic more explicit and easier to understand.

```php
$a = 1;
$b = "1";

if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Identical\n"; // This will NOT execute
}

if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Equal (loose comparison)\n"; // This will execute
}

//Best practice: Use strict comparison unless you have a specific reason not to.

$x = 10;
$y = '10';

if ($x === $y) {
    echo "Values are identical in type and value.\n";
} else {
    echo "Values are different in type or value.\n";
}
```
By adopting a consistent use of `===`, you make your code's intent clearer, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior due to implicit type conversions.
